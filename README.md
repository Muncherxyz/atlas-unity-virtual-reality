Challenges:

 This projects main struggle was figuring out how to setup videos using a render texture in order to force it to wrap around the users field of view. You are replacing the skybox within unity with the video to create this "360" effect with a video. 


 Purpose:
-
The purpose of this project was to learn how to setup a VR environment within unity. It taught me how to use render textures in order to manipulate the skybox. It also allowed me to learn the fundamentals of developing UI for VR experiences.
